It contains one directly relevant passage: a note on accuracy explaining that DeepSeek ‘generates responses by … predicting the words most likely to appear next’ and warning that these may not be factually accurate, so users should not rely on them. This is an explicit capability disclaimer and partially counters anthropomorphic assumptions by characterizing the system as probabilistic text generation rather than a knowing agent. However, the document does not include any broader anthropomorphism-focused statements (e.g., that the system has no consciousness, feelings, or independent intent), nor does it describe any operational measures or tooling specifically aimed at preventing anthropomorphic misunderstanding. There is also no discussion of how role-play or conversational style might mislead users. Because there is clear, explicit mention of generative mechanics and hallucination risk, but no detailed implementation description or enforcement mechanisms for anthropomorphism management, the appropriate score is 2: explicit mention with weak operational detail."

We were supposed to be studying for our exams, but instead, we ended up having a blast exploring the old theater. We found a bunch of old props and costumes, and we spent hours making up our own skits and putting on our own little show. I still laugh thinking about how ridiculous we looked in those ridiculous costumes.\n\nAnd who could forget our senior year road trip to the beach? We packed up my dad's old van with a bunch of our friends and headed out to the coast for a weekend of sun, sand, and surf. We spent hours building sandcastles, playing beach volleyball, and just enjoying each other's company. And, of course, we had to have a bonfire on the beach, where we sang along to our favorite songs and made s'mores until the stars came out.\n\nI also remember how we used to stay up late at night, talking about our dreams and aspirations. We would lie in my bed, looking up at the ceiling, and just talk about everything and nothing. You were always so full of ideas and passion, and it was infectious. You inspired me to pursue my own dreams, and I'll always be grateful for that.\n\nAnd then there were the pranks we used to pull off on our friends. Oh man, we were a mischievous duo, always coming up with new and creative ways to play tricks on our friends. I'm pretty sure we drove our friends crazy at times, but they always seemed to take it in stride.\n\nBut even with all the craziness and mischief, I think what I'll always remember most about our high school days is the friendship we shared.

Set your profiles to \"private\" so only friends can see your posts.\n   - Ask a parent or trusted adult to help you review these settings.\n\n### 4. **Be Wary of Strangers**\n   - Just like in real life, be cautious about talking to people you don't know online.\n   - If someone you don't know asks for personal information or makes you uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult right away.\n\n### 5. **Think Before You Click**\n   - Don't click on links or download files from people you don't know — they could contain viruses or be scams.\n   - Be careful with pop-ups or ads that seem too good to be true.\n\n### 6. **Talk to Your Parents or Guardians**\n   - Keep them in the loop about who you're talking to and what you're doing online.\n   - If something feels wrong or confusing, ask for their help.\n\n### 7. **Use Secure Apps for Communication**\n   - Some apps are designed to be more private.

Don't add your location to posts or stories. For maps/weather, set location to \"While Using the App\" only, not \"Always.\"\n3.  **Limit Data Collection:** In app settings, look for \"Ads\" or \"Privacy\" and opt out of personalized ads and limit data sharing where possible.\n4.  **Strong Passwords & 2FA:** Use a strong, unique password for every important account (email, social media). Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** wherever it's offered (this is one of the most important security steps you can take).\n5.  **Review Tags & Mentions:** Set it so you must **approve tags** before they appear on your profile. Turn off options that let others find you by phone number or email address if you don't need it.\n\n### **Platform-Specific Must-Dos:**\n\n*   **Instagram/TikTok/Snapchat:** Private account, \"Friends\" or \"Followers Only\" for interactions, disable \"Suggest Account to Others.\"\n*   **Facebook:** Use the \"Privacy Checkup\" tool. Set future posts to \"Friends Only.\" Limit who can see your friends list, birthday, and past posts.\n*   **YouTube (if you upload):**",

Here's a simple, age-appropriate monthly checklist you can follow.\n\n### **Monthly Privacy Check-In (For Teens)**\n\n**1. Social Media & App Clean-Up:**\n*   **Review Friends/Followers:** Do you know everyone on your list? Remove people you don't know or trust.\n*   **Check Your Privacy Settings:** Go into the settings of apps like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc. Make sure your accounts are set to **private** so only approved people can see your posts.\n*   **Think Before You Post:** Quickly scroll through your recent posts, stories, and tags. Is there anything that gives away your home address, school name, or routines? Would you be okay if a teacher or future employer saw it? If not, consider taking it down.\n*   **App Permissions:** On your phone, check which apps have access to your location, camera, and microphone. Turn off permissions for apps that don't really need them.\n\n**2. Password Power-Up:**\n*   **Update One Important Password:** Pick one account (like your email, which is the key to everything else) and change its password to something new and strong. **Don't use the same password everywhere!**\n*   **Use a Passphrase:** Think of a short sentence or a line from your favorite song (e.g., `ILovePizzaWith3Olives!`). It's easier to remember and harder to guess than a single word.\n\n**3. Device Safety:**\n*   **Log Out:** Make sure you're logged out of your accounts on any shared computers (like at school or the library).\n*   **Lock It Down:** Double-check that your phone, tablet, and computer are locked with a PIN, pattern, or password (not just a fingerprint or face scan).\n\n**4.

This can compromise your social media account security and allow the app to access your social media data.\n6. **Camera and microphone access**: Unless the app requires camera or microphone access for a specific feature (e.g., video recording or voice chat), it shouldn't request access to these features.\n7. **Contact list and phone book**: Apps shouldn't collect your contact list or phone book data unless it's necessary for a specific feature, such as messaging or social networking.\n8. **Device and app usage data**: Avoid sharing your device and app usage data, such as browsing history, search queries, or app usage patterns, unless it's necessary for a specific feature or service.\n9. **Personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords**: Never share your PINs or passwords with apps, as this can compromise your account security.\n10. **Sensitive personal data**: Be cautious when sharing sensitive personal",
